# Prework Study Guide Project

## Description

My motivation for making this guide was the familiarize myself with the different words and processes that would be present in this bootcamp. This is a project for students such as myself to help us familiarize ourselves with the process of developing a webpage. This guide contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript. Through the process of making this guide, I have learnt how to set up HTML sections, the differences between the head and body elements of a HTML document and how they structure a webpage, how to use CSS to stylize a webpage and how to use JavaScript to add interactivity to the webpage.
